# Quiz Game Gothenburg

A graphical **Quiz Game** built with **C#**, **.NET**, and **WPF (XAML)**.  
Players can **play**, **edit**, or **create** quizzes — each in separate views using `UserControls`.

## Features

###  **Play Mode**
Play quizzes with multiple-choice questions (three options each).  
There are **two types of quizzes**:
1. **Built-in “Gothenburg” Quiz**   
       - Comes preloaded with questions about Gothenburg.  
       - Cannot be edited or deleted by the user.  
    
2. **User-Created Quizzes**   
       - Created and saved by the user inside the app.  
       - Stored as JSON files in AppData.  
       - Initially, this section is **empty**, and the *“Play Random User Quiz”* button is **disabled** until the user creates a quiz.

While playing, questions appear in **random order**, and after each answer you’ll see:
- ✅ Total correct answers  
- 📊 Percentage of correct answers

###  **Edit Mode:**  
- Choose the quize and question in the menu to edit it.  
- Allows modifying the quiz title and question text or any of its answers.  
- Supports deleting individual questions.  
- If all questions are deleted, the app asks whether to:
  - ❌ Delete the quiz file, or  
  - 📂 Keep the empty quiz.

###  **Create Mode:**  
- Lets you name a new quiz and add as many questions as you want.  
- Each question includes **three answer choices** and one **correct answer**.  
- Quizzes are saved asynchronously in **JSON format**.


###  **JSON Data:**
All quizzes and questions are saved and loaded from JSON files in your local AppData.
(C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\QuizGameWPF\DefaultData\)

- **Improve the WPF UI** with animations and adaptive layouts.  
- **Build a cross-platform version** using **.NET MAUI** (the app currently runs only on Windows).
