# Quiz Game Gothenburg

A graphical **Quiz Game** built with C# and WPF (XAML UI).  
Players can **play**, **edit**, or **create** quiestions — all through separate views using `UserControls`.


### Features

- 🎮 **Play Mode:**  
  Play through quizzes with multiple-choice questions (3 options each).  
  Questions appear in **random order**, and after each answer, you’ll see:  
  - Total correct answers  
  - Percentage of correct answers

- ✏️ **Edit Mode:**  
  View all questions in a quiz, select one, and modify its text or answer options.
  Delete a question directly. If a quiz has no questions left, you’ll be asked if you want to delete the entire quiz or keep it empty.

- 🧠 **Create Mode:**  
  Create new questions, add as many questions as you like, mark the correct answer, and save them as **JSON**.

- 💾 **JSON Data:**
  All quizzes and questions are saved and loaded from JSON files in your local AppData.
